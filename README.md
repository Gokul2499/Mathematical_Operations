# Basic Arithmetic Operations in Python

This Python program allows the user to input two numbers and calculates the **sum**, **difference**, **product**, and **division** of those numbers.

## Features

- Accepts user input for two numbers
- Performs:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (with zero division handling)
- Displays the results in a readable format

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine

## How to Run

1. **Download or copy** the Python script.
2. **Open a terminal** or command prompt.
3. **Navigate** to the folder containing the script.
4. Run the program using:

   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

   Replace `filename.py` with the actual name of your Python file (e.g., `calculator.py`).

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 2
Sum: 10.0
Difference: 6.0
Product: 16.0
Division: 4.0
```

## Notes

- Division by zero is handled gracefully with a custom message.
- Input values are converted to floating-point numbers to allow decimal operations.
